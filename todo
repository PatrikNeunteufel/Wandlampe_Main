- Startup Sign when power back with no light switched on (with mobile or buttons)
- setup the orientation for the startingpixel of the led-stripe
  - optional with MPU 5060 (GY-521)
- add audio-in (microphone) to create vu-meter programs
- implemetation for the control of the main light (power LED, pwm for MOSFET)
- add WIFI / Bluetooth, as soon i get my NodeMCU
- 3d Print the case and count the final number of LED per Side


after Prototype:
- create Master/Slave system for multiple Lamps
- Slaves only need a Arduino Nano or maybe a reduced Clone
- Maste maybe Arduino Mega or extended Memory
- Think about power refreshing units
